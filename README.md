# News-Recommendation-System

<p align="justify">News are newly received notable information concerning place or group or things. Everyone is concerned with the news on their own way. But it is hard to categorize the interest of news readers with one another. A recommendation system would be great idea to make a news reader familiar with only those contents he/she want to know about. So, we are developing a real news recommendation system where we recommend the only news readers the true news of their interests. Plus there is a separate section for the Fake News Detection where when are news are given input, they can be validated as true or false. We are doing this because in the real-life scenario people face problem reading the news article of their choice and we aim to solve this problem. The output of this work can be implemented in various online news portals.</p>

<b><h>Abstract</h></b>
<p align="justify">In the digital world of enormous flow of data, we could find ourselves at various
crossroads that lead to different platforms containing the needed data. Between the
options of saving time or checking all platforms, our project merges the
crossroads to become one. The project “Real News Recommendation System”
utilizes the click behaviour of users and recommends them the best news articles
by analysing if the news is fake or not. We felt that a project like “Real News
Recommendation System” was needed for the technological aspects relating
closely to our nation and the emergence of its numerous news portals. We have
created the project as a web application using Python and Django along with the
concepts of NLP (Natural Language Processing). The project utilizes the concept
of recommendation of online news understanding the importance of relevant news
recommendation for the users who read news every day. We hope that our project
can impact all Nepali news readers and give them an essence of multi-
dimensionality in a concise and time saving manner.</p>
